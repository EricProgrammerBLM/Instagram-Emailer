Instagram Emailer
This is Written using Appium for Mobile Devices. Specifically Androids

Its meant to go through any comment section, and send an email to anyone that left a comment, or anyone that was tagged in the comments. Its still going through development so somethings might be a bit bugged.

It connects to my Google Cloud and saves the data of every profile we have visited in the past, to my Google Sheets API. This way we know not to spam them multiple times via Email. I may use SQL Instead, still considering it....

Im looking specifically for music artist to target, so thats why some of the keywords look for things like 'artist' in the bio.
